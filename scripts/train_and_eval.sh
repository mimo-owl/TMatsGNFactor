# we set experiment name as method+date. you could specify it as you like.

# set the gpu id for training. we use two gpus for training. you could also use one gpu, but need to set `num_devices=1`.

# set the gpu id for evaluation. we use one gpu for parallel evaluation.
eval_gpu="0"
# set the port for ddp training.
port="12345"
# you could disable wandb by this.
